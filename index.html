<p align = "justify"> <b> Tekken </b> is a Japanese media franchise centered on a series of fighting games developed and published by <i> Bandai Namco Entertainment </i>. The franchise also includes film and print adaptations.</p> 

<p align = "justify"> The main games in the series follow the events of the King of Iron Fist Tournament, hosted by the <i> Mishima Zaibatsu </i>, where players control a plethora of characters to win the tournament and gain control of the company; the conflict between the Mishima family serves as the main focus of the series' plot, while players explore other characters' motivations in aiming to control the Zaibatsu.</p> 

<p align = "justify"> Gameplay focuses on hand-to-hand combat with an opponent, with the gameplay system including blocks, throws, escapes, and ground fighting. The series later introduced combos and special moves, with characters also able to stage break arenas. Tekken is noted as being one of the first fighting games at the time to use 3D animation.</p>

<p align = "justify"> All major installments of the series are originally arcade games, and the boards used to run them have traditionally been based on PlayStation hardware.

<p align = "justify"> As with many fighting games, players choose a character from a lineup and engage in hand-to-hand combat with an opponent. Traditional fighting games are usually played with buttons which correspond to the strength of the attack, such as strong punch or weak kick. Tekken, however, dedicates a button to each of the four limbs of the fighter. The gameplay system includes blocks, throws, escapes, and ground fighting. </p>
